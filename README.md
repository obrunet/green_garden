# Green Garden Bot


This python 3 script automates a random number of commits on a daily basis in order to turn your GitHub page green
it uses bash commands, in a future version github APIs will be added.

HOW TO:
    - First, you've to clone a private repository in the same folder where this script is run.
    - It checks if the configuration file is correct, otherwise creates it based on user inputs (user & repo names)
    - It also prompt the user for the github password (this password is erased at the end and not saved).


TO DO:
- add the script at startup (so that it's automatically run when you switch on your computer)
- use the github APIs
